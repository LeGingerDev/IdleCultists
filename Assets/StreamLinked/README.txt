This project is divided into seperate sections related to their respective sections of Twitchs API and build sections.
Twitch classes and references are found under the folders:
	- TwitchAPI 		[https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/]
	- TwitchEventSub 	[https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/]
	- TwitchIRC 		[https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/]
Twitch CLI is not included due to it packaged and download format style, I may look into a way to incorperate this package but as of now it is not included.
https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/

Unity specific classes and builds can be found under:
	- ManagersAndBuilders 	[TwitchIRC chat badge and emote downloading and processing]
	- Other					[Debug, PlayerPrefs, Singletons and Extensions]
	- Prefabs				[Example scene prefabs]
	- Scenes				[Example scene files]
	- TwitchSceneFiles		[Example scene code]
	- TwitchStatics			[Static code and data]

Archived code due for removal is found under this folder. It follows the same folder structure and namespaces as the active files for ease of access.
It is not recommended to use this code as it will no longer be maintained and commented out/removed in a future update.
Use of any code found in this area will prompt you a [depreciated] warning.

JSON
This project uses JSON to process the information provided by Twitch, all objects have specifically implemented reading from LightJson.JsonValue objects.
This is due to NetStandard compatibility and also due to its compact nature.
Switching out LightJson should see no issues for compatbility (JSON format)
However due care is needed due to its heavy inclusion.
